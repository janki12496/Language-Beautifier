# Language-Beautifier

Many software tools that manipulate source programs first perform some kind of analysis. This program puts an appropriate hierarchical structure on the source program. Output of this would be the same source program in much readable form.

See Output.png for following input: "#include<stdio.h>#include<conio.h>void main(){int a=5,b;for(b=0;b<a;b++){printf(b);}a++;}"
